Better/Faster Version of GrowtopiaNoobs's GrowtopiaServer Project. (**The First Growtopia Private Server with ENet**)

This project has been compiled with Visual Studio 2022 and 2019 or other compilers weren't been tested.

This project has been published under GNU AFFERO GPL license, so you need to **publish the whole source code and citate the orginal authors name, even if you are using your server as service**!

# **TODO list:**
- [X] ENet Functions For Connectivity (using ENet C++ Library)
- [ ] Item Serializing (support for new v15)
- [X] Readable and Easy to Use/Understand
- [ ] Write event pool - this is needed to delay actions like respawning
- [ ] Make heavy events asynchronous with possibly some good thread count (probably one or two) and connect them to event pool or use callbacks
- [X] Premium World Lock System (Used to purchase ingame goods)
- [X] Discord Webhook Code (discord_webhook.h)
- [X] World Lock Algorithm (Wl, Dl, BGL, etc)
- [ ] Tile Algorithm (Sl, Bl, Hl, Builder Lock)
